# Supermarket-Sales-Prediction

The "Supermarket Sales Prediction" project is a comprehensive machine learning initiative that aims to forecast sales based on a diverse set of features. The dataset encompasses crucial details such as Invoice ID, Branch, City, Customer type, Gender, Product line, Unit price, Quantity, Tax 5%, Total, Date, Time, Payment method, COGS (Cost of Goods Sold), Gross Margin Percentage, Gross Income, and Customer Rating.

The project follows a systematic lifecycle, beginning with data exploration and cleaning. Statistical methods are employed to identify outliers, handle missing values, and ensure the dataset's integrity. The Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries are then utilized for data visualization, providing insightful visual representations of the relationships between various features and sales outcomes.

During the feature engineering phase, relevant features are selected, and new features may be created to enhance model performance. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the machine learning model.

The machine learning model leverages predictive analytics to forecast supermarket sales. Various algorithms are tested, and the most suitable models are selected based on their performance metrics. Statistical methods, such as hypothesis testing, may be employed to validate the significance of selected features in predicting sales.
